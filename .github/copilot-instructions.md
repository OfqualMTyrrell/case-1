This project is a React app created with create-react-app and includes the IBM Carbon Design System (carbon-components-react, @carbon/icons-react, @carbon/themes).

You should always use the latest documentation provided by the Carbon Design System here: https://carbondesignsystem.com/ and the latest code from the repository here: https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/react

For every page use the carbon design system 2x grid. We need a 16 column grid https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/code/ using the Product and docs model with a narrow mode gutter (16px) - do not use <rows>
