  "complaintSummary": "Candidate alleges unfair treatment during practical assessment, claiming assessor was biased and marking criteria were not clearly explained.",
  
  "detailedComplaint": "I am writing to formally complain about the conduct of the practical assessment component of my Level 3 Certificate in Digital Marketing examination on 15th May 2025.\n\nDuring the assessment, I felt that the assessor, Mr. James Wilson, displayed unprofessional behavior and potential bias against me. Specifically:\n\n1. The assessor interrupted my work multiple times with unnecessary comments that broke my concentration\n2. When I asked for clarification on the marking criteria, I was told to 'figure it out yourself'\n3. Other candidates appeared to receive more guidance and support than I did\n4. The assessor made several dismissive comments about my approach before I had completed the task\n\nI believe this treatment affected my performance and resulted in an unfair assessment outcome. I am requesting a review of my assessment and consideration of a re-sit under different assessment conditions.\n\nI have witnesses to some of these incidents, including another candidate who was sitting nearby during the assessment.",
  
  "desiredOutcome": "I would like my assessment to be reviewed and marked by an independent assessor, and if bias is found to have occurred, I request a re-sit of the practical component under fair conditions.",
